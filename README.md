# Working with arrays. Exploring array sorting methods in C

I m created random numbers and string in structs and sorting by qsort and shell sort

Condition:

1. A program that reads an array from a text file, sorts it and writes it
result to another text file.
2. A program that performs timing of array sorting.
Programs 1 and 2 must implement support for working with three sorting algorithms:
two from an individual task and with the implementation of the quick sort algorithm from the standard library - the qsort () function.
Program 1 should receive the following parameters via command line arguments:
1. Sorting algorithm (via option).
2. The field by which sorting is carried out (via the option).
3. Sort direction (via option).
4. The name of the input file (via the obligatory positional argument).
5. The name of the output file (via the obligatory positional argument).
Program 2 should receive the following parameters via command line arguments:
1. Sorting algorithm (via option).
2. The field by which sorting is carried out (via the option).
3. Sort direction (via option).
4. The number of elements in the generated arrays (via the obligatory positional argument).
5. The number of generated arrays (via the obligatory positional argument).

Task : 

Data structure:
Event log entry:
• identifier (integer);
• severity level (an integer indicating one of the following levels: debug, info, warn,
error, fatal);
• text (arbitrary length string).


Sorting algorithms:
1. Quick sort.
2. Shell sort.
